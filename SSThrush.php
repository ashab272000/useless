				<h3>
				Historical Information
				</h3>
				<p>
					A Royal Fleet Auxiliary salvage steamer and former gun-boat, she was built in 1889 by Scottâ€™s of Greenock, and is reputed to have been commanded for a time by the then future King George V.<br>
    				She grossed 805 tons, measured 50.29 x 9.44m. originally with 6 x four inch guns.<br>
    				She was assigned to the Coastguard in 1906 and became a cable ship in 1915. She was operating as a salvage ship at the time of loss.<br>
    				Nine men drowned when she was wrecked during a snowstorm. The rest were rescued by breeches buoy.<br>
    				The bell was recovered as recently as August 1993.

				<h3>
			    Diving Information
