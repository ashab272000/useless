				<h3>
				Historical Information
				</h3>
				<p>
					Built by Swan Hunter, Haverton Hill, in the 1970’s, she grossed 89,438 tons and measuered 294.13 x 44.19 x 25.01 metres.<br>
    				Is the largest wreck in Europe.<br>
    				Was carrying 165,000 tons of iron ore and 2,000 tons of oil from Seven Islands, Quebec for the River Clyde.<br>
    				Ran aground on the Stagg Rocks during a gale after losing steerage.<br>
    				She had previously sheltered for a few days in Bantry Bay to repair cracks in her decks before venturing out.<br>
    				The 28 crew were air-lifted off by the RAF, and her engines were left running in reverse to try and dislodge her.<br>
    				The Dutch tug "Smit Rotterdam" failed to tow her off.<br>
    				The following Spring she broke in three and sank.<br>
    				The vessel was worth £8.4m. and the cargo £2.7m.<br>
    				Her 1,200 tons of bunker fuel caused serious pollution in the area.
