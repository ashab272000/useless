				<h3>
				Historical Information
				</h3>
				<p>
					She is thought to be a former the Belgian Royal Yacht.<br>
    				She foundered on rocks at Red Bay, when in service for the Royal Navy. Much of it was salvaged by Murray Bros. of Waterfoot.<br>
    				One of the Murray Brothers was attacked by a conger, estimated at over 20ft. long. He is said to have never dived again as a result.<br>
    				The main shaft was sold to the lime works in Glenarm.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h3>
			    Diving Information
				</h3>
				<p>
					Mainly broken sections, the largest being the boiler.<br>
    				A large proportion was salvaged, and what is left is well embedded in the sandy bottom.<br>
    				Should be dived on an incoming tide as the slip is left high and dry at Low Water.<br>
    				Use 65 degrees x 500yds from Church.
